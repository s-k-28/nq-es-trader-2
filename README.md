## Strategy

- **OU Reversion**: Mean-reversion on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (PF 3.10, 131 trades)
- **VWAP Reversion**: VWAP-based mean reversion (PF 1.83, 197 trades)

Overall (filtered): 67.8% win rate, 2.30 profit factor, 323 trades with dynamic sizing.
Signals with 30-50 tick risk are skipped (55% WR noise).

Mon-Fri mornings, up to 20 MNQ dynamically sized per trade risk.

**Adaptive Withdrawals**: Extract $500-$2K whenever balance exceeds DD floor + $2K buffer.
Requires 5 winning days ($150+) per TopStepX rules. 60 withdrawals in backtest.

## Risk Management

- Dynamic position sizing: `qty = min(20, floor($500 / (risk_ticks * $0.50)))` caps max trade loss at $500
- $500 prospective daily loss cap (skip trades if worst-case would breach)
- Progressive DD scaling: reduce to 50% as drawdown grows from $1K to $1.5K
- 75% size after 2 consecutive losing days (streak protection)
- $2,000 trailing drawdown (locks at $50K floor when peak hits $52K)
- Skip 30-50 tick risk signals (dead zone filter)
- $2,000 adaptive withdrawal buffer above DD floor
- Breakeven stops, partial exits
- Time stops per model (30-45 min)
- Auto-flatten at 2:55 PM CT
